                        <dd class="text-justify"><p>The fact that a lot of engineering and scientific work is now done on a computer creates a tendency to believe that the fields have evolved along with technology. This is not the case. It is true that we now use CAD and that many other things that were once done by hand are now done through computer programs. However, taking an action that was once done by hand and doing it on a computer is not the same as taking full advantage of what computers can do.</p>
<p>Engineering, math, and science are too bloated, too labor intensive, too slow, and too expensive. Our goal is to change that.</p></dd>

                        <dd class="text-justify"><p>There are two major problems. First, we use too many platforms. We use platforms to analyze data and design components, another to document results, and possibly still another to crunch large amounts of data. CADWOLF takes all of those tasks and moves them to one - web based - platform. Everyone is on the same page doing the same thing with the same software.</p>
<p>The second problem involves the amount of time to redesign components. Engineers typically design a component only to see requiremnts change a week later and their entire analysis and documentation has to be updated. Today, large changes can take dozens of engineers weeks or months to adatpt to. CADWOLF does this in a matter of seconds.</p></dd>

                        <dd class="text-justify"><p>CADWOLF will eventually contain a full CAD system that is integrated with all other aspects of the system, making it the first CAD system based on the mathematics of the parts represented. This means that when a design changes, both the math and the CAD will change as well.</p></dd>

                        <dd class="text-justify"><p>For as long as possible, CADWOLF will be free for students and for engineers or entrepreneurs who are not yet making money. People should not have to pay for a license to learn a platform to expand their careers. Any engineer that wants to design a product to change the world should have access to quality engineering software as a means to develop that idea.</p></dd>
